Ideas on setting up a starter Wordpress site

## Random Thoughts

Should have a list of plugins used and a script that downloads the latest version
- wp db migrate pro
- advanced custom fields
    - Repeater
- regenerate thumbnails
- some sort of custom post type plugin [types](https://wordpress.org/plugins/types/)
- a slider plugin of post types (maybe custom)
- Most want an SEO plugin
- Gravity forms

Need a list of go to javascript libraries
- jquery (still easiest to use)
- modernizr
- combine/document past useful libraries use in WP projects

HTML/SASS primers
- Import a library of already setup SCSS library and HTML starters. Look at libarary [dropdabase](https://github.com/ckollars/dropdabase)
- Include animate.css
- use a styleguid system
- Look at using TWIG [timber](http://upstatement.com/timber/)
